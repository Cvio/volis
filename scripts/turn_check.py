"""Turn-based mode against real devices, through the VB-Audio cable (the
Rust M6 checks, repeated).

    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts\\turn_check.py

The cable is the microphone ("CABLE Output") and the speakers ("CABLE Input").
  1. Between turns the microphone is closed: speech played while idle produces
     nothing, no level reports, and the capture device isn't open.
  2. A turn captures everything said in it as one utterance, pauses included:
     two clips with a 2 s pause between them come out as one transcript.
  3. Taking a turn stops a reply mid-word.
  4. The mode changes while running: continuous then hears without the key.
Nothing comes out of the real speakers.
