"""The P12 check, as far as one machine can do it: the built folder
(dist\\volis\\) runs on its own and opens no connections.

    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts\\p12_check.py [folder]

Runs the built volis.exe, never this repository's Python:

  1. --doctor: every library present and loaded from the folder;
  2. --report: every model found under the folder's own models\\;
  3. file mode on the Spanish and the Arabic fixture recordings, translated
     by Qwen3 1.7B (small enough to share the GPU), with the recognizers this
     machine's checks use; transcript CER and translation chrF against the
     references; and the same run from source, to compare the time (streaming
     and the other settings are volis-python.toml's, the same for both);
  4. for each run, every network connection the process holds, sampled every
     0.2 s with psutil: there must be none.

Run from a copy of the folder elsewhere (another drive, a renamed folder) to
show nothing points back at the repository. Not covered, because they need a
second machine or a person: no Python and no internet on the machine, the
window from a double-click, the microphone, paired mode.
