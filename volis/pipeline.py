"""The pipeline: audio source -> VAD -> recognizer -> guards -> sentences ->
translator -> events.

Port of the continuous-listening core of Rust `pipeline.rs` (voice, turns,
sharing and pairing join it at P5 to P10). The pipeline reports only through
events (events.py) on a queue; `--listen`, file mode and the window are all
consumers of the same events, as in Rust.

Threads, as Rust, with the costs in mind:
  capture or file source   hands 16 kHz chunks on (audio.py, ArraySource)
  pipeline                 the detector only: it must never fall behind the audio
  recognition              its own thread: the final pass over each utterance
                           and, when streaming, a provisional pass over the
                           growing utterance every interval (LocalAgreement).
                           Live, if a provisional pass is still running when
                           the next is due, only the newest is kept; a fast
                           file run does every pass, so it measures what live
                           use would produce
  translation              its own thread, so a slow model never stalls
                           recognition; a queue of TRANSLATION_QUEUE sentences
  speaking                 synthesis on its own thread; the sound card's
                           callback plays it (playback.py), and the half-duplex
                           gate keeps the microphone from hearing it
  stall probe              a 50 ms timer that reports when Python's threads
                           are held up (a library holding the GIL): the early
                           warning for the window's responsiveness (P5)
Live, a sentence the translator can't take in time is dropped and reported,
as Rust does; from a file, the pipeline waits instead, so a file run never
loses a sentence. Streaming (P7) and revision (P8) add threads of their own.
