"""What the events do to the window. No Qt in this file: it is plain Python,

One difference in shape from Rust: a caption there is an utterance with one
translation; here a row is a sentence (volis translates per sentence), and
the same rows are the live captions and the file timeline. Turn-taking,
pairing and the shared machine join at P6, P9 and P10.
