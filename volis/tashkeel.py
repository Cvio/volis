"""Vowel marks for Arabic before it is spoken ([tts] diacritize).

New in volis. Arabic is written without its short vowels, and a Piper voice
pronounces what it is given: Piper itself restores the marks first, with a
small model (libtashkeel), and its Arabic voices were trained on text marked
that way. sherpa-onnx runs the voice without that step, so unmarked words
come out wrong. This is that step: a port of piper-phonemize's `tashkeel.cpp`
(MIT), running the same model file, `libtashkeel_model.ort`, with onnxruntime.

Marks already in the text are removed and predicted again, as Piper does. The
model takes 315 characters at a time; longer text is marked piece by piece,
cut at spaces.
