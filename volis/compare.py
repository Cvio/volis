"""The dual-run comparison harness. Port of Rust `compare.rs`.

Runs one utterance through every usable segment recognizer and reports, side
by side: the transcript, the wall-clock time, and the segment's duration
(Whisper pads to 30 s internally, so time means nothing without it).

New in volis: engines run through the hallucination guards too, and GPU
memory is managed. Rust keeps every engine loaded; on an 8 GB GPU the
downloaded models don't all fit at once. So each engine is loaded if it fits
beside the others and kept; one that doesn't fit is loaded for its turn and
released straight after ("swapped"). Engines always run one after another,
never at once, so the timings measure the models, not contention.
