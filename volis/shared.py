"""Shared-machine mode: two people who speak different languages use one
machine, each with their own key. Port of Rust `shared.rs`.

The key says who is talking, and so which language they speak. Each side has
its own recognizer, chosen for that side's language, so a model tuned for one
language can hear one person while another hears the other.

This module is the rule that turns "which side pressed" into a direction: the
recognizer and language to hear it with, the language to translate into, and
the voice to speak it with. It has no window, device or model in it, so every
case is tested directly.
