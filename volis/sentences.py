"""Splitting a transcript into sentences.

New in volis. Rust translates each utterance the VAD cut, which can be half
a sentence or three. volis translates sentences: everything downstream
(context, fragment holding, revision, subtitles, the timeline) is per
sentence, and every sentence has a stable id, "<utterance>.<sentence>".

A sentence ends at final punctuation (. ? ! … and the Arabic ؟) followed by a
space or the end. Text with no final punctuation at all, which is what MMS
and some Whisper models produce, stays one sentence per utterance: Rust's
behaviour. Times come from word timings when the recognizer gives them, and
are otherwise shared out over the utterance by length, marked approximate.
