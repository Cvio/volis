"""Paired mode (SPEC §9): two Volis instances on a local network as the two
ends of one conversation. Port of Rust `peer.rs`; the two pair with each other.

Each machine runs its own complete pipeline and sends the other only the
translated **text**. The receiver shows it and speaks it with its own voice.
No audio, no models and no inference cross the wire.

Everything here runs on its own threads, so a stalled or dead peer can never
block local capture, recognition or the window:

* the **peer thread** owns the connection, the handshake and the floor token,
  and is the only thing that writes to the socket;
* an **acceptor** waits for the other side to dial in;
* a **dialler** makes one outgoing attempt when the user presses Connect;
* a **reader** per connection turns lines into messages.

Only IP addresses are accepted. A name would be resolved by the system's
resolver, which can mean a public DNS server, and the first hard constraint
forbids that. Everything works on a cable or a switch with no router, no DHCP
and no DNS.
