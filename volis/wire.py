"""The paired-mode wire protocol (SPEC §9): newline-delimited JSON over TCP.

Port of Rust `wire.rs`, version 2, unchanged: volis pairs with volis-rust.
Only text crosses it: never audio, never models, never context, never a
revision.

Everything that arrives is untrusted. `decode` bounds every length, refuses
a line that is not UTF-8, refuses an unknown protocol version, and strips
control characters from every string, so what comes out is only ever
displayed or spoken. Received text is never a command, a path, or an
instruction to a model, and `source_text` is never translated again.
