"""Quick scoring of a file run against a reference: CER of the transcript and
chrF of the translation, with model-bench's text cleaning (textclean.py,
copied from it) and its chrF (sacrebleu's CHRF, default settings).

A quick check, not the proof: model-bench is the proof. Scores are over the
whole file, the transcript and the translation each joined into one text, so
how the recognizer cut sentences doesn't change them.

A reference sits next to the audio file:
  <file>.ref.json   {"transcript": "...", "translation": "..."}, either may be absent
  <file>.ref.srt    the transcript, as subtitles (timings ignored)
