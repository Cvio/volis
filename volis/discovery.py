"""Finding other Volis PCs on the local link (SPEC §9), so the peer panel can
offer a pick-list instead of making someone type an address.

Port of Rust `discovery.rs`; the announcement is the same, so volis and
volis-rust find each other. Convenience only: managed switches and VLANs drop
broadcast, so typing the address must always work and nothing depends on
this. A UDP broadcast on port 47801: every couple of seconds each Volis
announces its name and port to every local network it is on, and listens for
the others. Broadcast never leaves the local link, needs no router, no DHCP
and no DNS, and works on a bare cable.
