"""Speech recognition: the two interfaces the pipeline talks to, and loading.

Port of the shape of Rust `asr.rs`. Whole-utterance recognizers (Whisper,
Parakeet, MMS, Cohere Transcribe) implement `SegmentAsr`; streaming
recognizers implement `StreamAsr` (P7). Which backend runs a model is decided
by discovery from the folder's contents (`models.py`); the pipeline never
knows.

Backends:
  sherpa        engine.toml folders, through sherpa-onnx exactly as Rust (asr/sherpa.py)
  transformers  downloaded Hugging Face folders (asr/hf.py)
