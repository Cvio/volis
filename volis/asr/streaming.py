"""Streaming recognition from a segment recognizer: LocalAgreement.

New in volis. A whole-utterance model (Whisper, Parakeet, Cohere) becomes a
streaming one by transcribing the growing audio again every short interval
and committing only the words two consecutive transcriptions agree on. What
is committed never changes; the rest is provisional and may.

    agreement = LocalAgreement(recognizer, "es")
    update = agreement.update(audio_so_far)   # every second while speech goes on
    update = agreement.finish(whole_audio)    # when the detector ends the utterance

Each call transcribes the audio from the trim point onward. When the
recognizer gives word timings, the buffer is trimmed at the end of a
committed sentence once it is long, so it never grows towards Whisper's 30
seconds and each pass stays cheap. Without timings nothing is trimmed (the
detector cuts an utterance at 20 s anyway).

The cost is real: every pass is a full transcription of the buffer. The
pipeline reports the recognizer's real-time factor, and above 1.0 streaming
can't keep up.
