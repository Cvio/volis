"""What the translation stage refuses, and how it cleans output.

Port of Rust `translate.rs`: `clean`, and the three guards. A small model
fails in ways worse than failing visibly, so these reject an output rather
than let it be captioned and spoken. All three were found in live sessions:

  echo           the source handed back unchanged
  recites        the model recited its own instructions (and, in volis,
                 the context it was given: P7)
  too long       far longer than the input: an answer or a ramble

Do not remove one without a replacement.
