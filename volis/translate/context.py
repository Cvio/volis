"""Translation with context: what came earlier, the glossary, and short
fragments held to be joined to what follows.

New in volis. In carry-forward mode each sentence is translated knowing the
recent conversation: the last few committed source sentences and their
translations are placed in the prompt as earlier turns of the chat (user turn
= source, assistant turn = translation), the most natural form for a chat
model, which then continues the pattern.

Context is untrusted text: it came from a recognizer. It never changes the
instructions, the guards still run on every output, and the "recites the
prompt" guard recognises recited context too (guards.leaks_the_prompt).
