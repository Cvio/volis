"""Revision mode: re-translating the last few sentences together once a new
one arrives, and replacing an earlier translation that changes.

New in volis. "Yo manejo." alone is "I manage."; followed by "Mi carro está
afuera." it is "I'll drive.", and only the later sentence can say so. After
each newly translated sentence the last K source sentences are translated
again as one text, with the conversation before them as context, and the
result is split back into sentences. Where a sentence's translation differs
from the one on screen, it is replaced.

What is never revised:

  - a sentence that has been handed to the voice: what was said can't be unsaid;
  - a sentence that ended more than `max_age` seconds before the newest one:
    the reader has moved on;
  - a sentence of more than `max_words` words: a long sentence carries its
    own meaning, and translating it again only rewords it. On read speech
    (long, unrelated sentences) revising everything gave 20 revisions in 14
    sentences and a worse translation (chrF 61.2 against 63.6);
  - the newest sentence: it was translated a moment ago with everything
    before it, and nothing new has been said;
  - a sentence that has been revised once already: a second look mostly
    flips between two wordings ("doesn't" / "does not" and back);
  - anything, when the new translation doesn't split into the same number of
    sentences as the source: there is then no telling which part belongs to
    which sentence, and a guess would put words under the wrong one.

Differences of case, spacing or punctuation alone are not revisions.
