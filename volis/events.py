"""Everything the pipeline reports, as events: one set for the window,
`--listen`, file mode and `events.jsonl`.

Port of Rust's `PipelineMsg`, extended. The whole set is defined now, so the
export format doesn't change as streaming (P7) and revision (P8) arrive;
an event a milestone doesn't produce yet is simply never sent.

Times: `wall` is seconds since the pipeline started (every event has it, set
when the event is made). `start`/`end` are seconds on the source's timeline:
for a file, the position in the file. Sentence ids are "<utterance>.<n>".
