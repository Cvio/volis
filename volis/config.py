"""`volis.toml` - user selections only, by directory name.

Port of Rust `config.rs`. The same file, the same keys, the same defaults and
the same strictness: a key that isn't one of Rust's is an error, because it is
almost always a typo, and because volis-rust would refuse the file anyway
(`#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` at every level, including the top). That is
also why volis never writes a section of its own here: a `volis.toml` saved
by volis must still load in volis-rust. volis-only settings get their own
file, `volis-python.toml`, once a milestone needs one.

A key left out of a section takes its default. A missing file is not an error
(the defaults apply); a malformed one is.
