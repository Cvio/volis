"""Playback, and the half-duplex gate that keeps volis from hearing itself.
Port of Rust `playback.rs`.

With the voice playing through speakers and the microphone live, the detector
triggers on the translated speech and the recognizer transcribes it: a loop.
The fix is not echo cancellation; it is not listening while speaking. So
playback owns a `Gate`. It closes when speech is queued for the sound card and
opens 150 ms after the last sample has played. While it is closed the pipeline
discards captured audio and holds the detector reset.

In turn-based mode (P6) the user decides when the microphone is live:
`PlaybackControl.begin_turn` cuts off any reply and holds what arrives until
`end_turn`.
