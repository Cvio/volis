"""Audio capture: device enumeration and a capture thread that hands the rest
of the pipeline 16 kHz mono float32.

Port of Rust `audio.rs`, on sounddevice (PortAudio) instead of cpal.
Resampling happens here, once, at the capture boundary. Every stage
downstream may assume 16 kHz mono float32 in [-1.0, 1.0] and nothing else.

Devices are the Windows WASAPI ones: cpal's default host on Windows is WASAPI,
so these are the names volis-rust lists and `[audio].input_device` holds.
(PortAudio also lists each device under MME, DirectSound and WDM-KS, where
MME truncates names to 31 characters.)

Two threads, as in Rust:

* PortAudio's callback runs on the device's own thread. It downmixes to mono
  and hands the samples off. It never resamples and never blocks: if the queue
  is full it drops the chunk and counts it.
* The capture thread owns the resampler and forwards 16 kHz chunks downstream.
