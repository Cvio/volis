# Handoff: where volis stands

> Renamed on 2026-10-03: this app was **pyvolis** and is now **volis** (package `volis`,
> `volis.exe`); the Rust app was volis and is now **volis-rust**. The Python-only settings file
> `pyvolis.toml` is now `volis-python.toml`, in the app folder and in model folders. Everything
> below was rewritten with the new names, including the history: read "volis" in an entry
> dated before the rename as the app then called pyvolis.

Last updated 2026-10-01. Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then `volis-build.md`.

## Status

- **P0 done:** paths and the offline environment, `volis.toml` load and save, discovery for
  `engine.toml` folders, Hugging Face folders and GGUF translators, `--report`, `doctor.ps1`,
  `fetch-model.ps1`, `parity\report.py`, and the offline test.
- **P1 done:** `--devices` (identical to Rust's output), microphone capture (`audio.py`), the
  file source (`filesource.py`, PyAV), Silero VAD with the pre-roll (`vad.py`), `volis-python.toml`
  with `[vad].pre_roll_ms`, `tests\fetch-fixtures.ps1`, and `scripts\vad_cuts.py` (cut points
  with and without the pre-roll, from a file, the fixtures or the microphone).
- **P2 done, one check partly open (below):** recognizers through sherpa-onnx (`asr/sherpa.py`)
  and transformers (`asr/hf.py`: Whisper, CTC with MMS adapters, Cohere Transcribe), the
  hallucination guards (`asr/guards.py`, `config/hallucinations.toml`), `ring.py`, `compare.py`,
  the pipeline core (`pipeline.py`) and `--listen` with `--seconds`, `--wav`, `--compare`.
  Scripts: `scripts/transcribe.py` (every model on the fixtures: CER, share of outputs without
  punctuation, real-time factor), `parity/asr.py` (volis-rust vs volis on the same audio).
- **P3 done:** GGUF translators through llama-cpp-python (`translate/llamacpp.py`), prompts from
  each model's own chat template, Rust's cleaning and three guards (`translate/guards.py`),
  prompt files (`prompts/`), several translators (`[translate]` in `volis-python.toml`), and
  `--translate` / `--print-prompt`. `parity/translate.py` compares with volis-rust.
- **P4 done:** `--file` (`filerun.py`): an audio file through the live pipeline, with sentences
  (`sentences.py`), a translation thread, the events (`events.py`), the export folder
  (`export.py`) and quick scores (`scoring.py`, with model-bench's `textclean.py` copied
  verbatim). `scripts/make_fixture_file.py` builds test recordings with references.
- **P5 done; the user ran its check on 2026-09-30** (a Spanish file, an Arabic file, a live
  conversation in the window: all three looked right). The window (`gui/window.py`,
  drawing `gui/session.py`), voice output (`tts.py`, `playback.py`, the half-duplex gate), and
  `--report --load`. Checked without a person: `scripts/window_check.py` (the window through a
  file run, offscreen, with a responsiveness measurement), `scripts/gate_check.py` (does volis
  hear itself, through the VB-Audio cable).
- **P6 done:** continuous and turn-based modes, switchable while running; the turn key in toggle
  and hold styles; the microphone device closed between turns; a turn as one utterance, trimmed
  of silence and split at pauses past 25 s; the three-state indicator. Checked against real
  devices by `scripts/turn_check.py` (15 of 15).
- **P7 done:** streaming recognition with LocalAgreement (`asr/streaming.py`), provisional
  text in the window, carry-forward context and the session glossary (`translate/context.py`),
  fragment holding, and a fourth hallucination guard (sparse text). Measured by
  `scripts/p7_check.py`; numbers under "P7 findings".
- **After P7, before P8 (2026-10-01):** the default prompt now frames the text, so questions
  and requests are translated instead of answered (differences 41, 42); the translator runs on
  the GPU when a GPU build is installed (43); GPU recognizers make a warm-up pass at load.
  Numbers under "After P7".
- **P8 done:** revision mode (`translate/revision.py`, `[context] mode = "revision"`, the
  window's "Revise earlier translations" box, `--context revision`), with its limits. Checked
  by `scripts/p8_check.py`; numbers under "P8 findings".
- **P9 done:** paired mode. `wire.py`, `floor.py`, `discovery.py` and `peer.py` are ports of
  the Rust modules, protocol version 2 unchanged; the pipeline routes a paired run's
  translations to the other PC and speaks what arrives; the window has the peer panel.
  Checked with volis at both ends (`tests/test_peer.py`, `tests/test_paired.py`) and against
  the real `volis-rust.exe` (`scripts/pair_check.py`, 12 of 12). See "P9 findings".
- **P10 done:** shared-machine mode, a recognizer per side, varieties per side. `shared.py`
  ports Rust's `shared.rs`; the pipeline loads each side's recognizer once and keeps it, takes
  a turn's recognizer, language, target and voice from the key that started it, and drops
  everything a cancelled turn had under way; the window has the third mode, the two columns
  and the two keys. Checked with real models by `scripts/shared_check.py`; the keys by
  `tests/test_shared_window.py`. Not yet tried by a person at the keyboard. See "P10 findings".
- **P11 done:** four more backends, each verified against the installed libraries before it
  was built: GGUF speech models through llama.cpp's audio input (`asr/llamacpp_audio.py`),
  LoRA adapters on GGUF translators and on transformers recognizers, and translators through
  transformers (`translate/hf.py`). Each ran a fixture recording end to end
  (`scripts/p11_check.py`). See "P11 findings".
- **After P11:** `MODELS.md` lists every model tested with its scores, and `fetch-models.ps1`
  (`scripts/fetch_models.py`) downloads the ones worth having into place with their settings
  files. Its settings files and its Piper conversion reproduce what is installed here byte
  for byte; **a download from nothing has not been run** (everything on the default list was
  already in place, except Gemma 3 12B and TranslateGemma 12B, which were deleted to save disk).
- **The user's own trials, 2026-10-02, on another PC:** `fetch-models.ps1` from nothing works;
  Gemma 4 E4B and Qwen3-ASR work in streaming and in shared machine mode; choosing Paired
  shows the firewall message and the addresses; Standard Arabic and Iraqi speech gave the same
  translations; Qwen3-ASR 1.7B and Voxtral are not good. Still to do by the user: two machines
  paired, and two people at one machine.
- **Decisions for P12, by the user:** NVIDIA machines only for now (so the GPU build of
  llama.cpp ships; a machine without an NVIDIA card is not a target); several GB for the
  folder is expected; choosing GPU or CPU is a nice-to-have (`[translate] device` exists).
  volis-rust's prompt stays as it is. Linux is not needed for now.
- **Holding speech for revision** (`[context] hold_speech`, off by default; difference 67),
  **vowel marks for Arabic voices** (`[tts] diacritize`, off by default; differences 68, 69) and
  `fetch-model.ps1 -Role tts` were added after P11, at the user's request. Whether the marks
  make the voices sound better has not been judged by a listener.
- **P12 done (on this machine):** `build.ps1` makes `dist\volis\` with PyInstaller in
  one-folder mode, which collected everything (no fallback to a shipped environment was
  needed). `volis.exe --doctor` checks the folder; `scripts\p12_check.py` runs the built
  program. See "P12 findings". **The check on a second machine (no Python, no internet) is the
  user's to do.**

## P13 to P20 (`volis-next-features.md`)

Eight milestones for non-technical users. Built in order; stop after each.

- **Before P13 (2026-10-06):** the repository now lives in `D:\AI_Data\projects\volis`. The Rust
  app is no longer on this machine and no longer a reference (the user's decision; `CLAUDE.md`
  says so). One test depended on a model that is no longer installed (the small Qwen3 at the
  top of `models\mt\`); it now checks the rule (the top-level file, else the first usable
  translator) whatever is installed. The tests that pin Qwen3's exact prompt text are skipped
  while that file is absent.
- **P13 done: Rescan.** A button, F5 and View > Rescan models and devices read `models\` and
  the audio devices again without restarting (`gui/rescan.py`, no Qt; `MainWindow.rescan`).
  Every list updates. A line under the button says, in plain words, what is new, what is gone,
  what stopped working and why, and what works again; and when a chosen model or device is
  gone, what replaced it: the best-ranked recognizer for the language, the first usable
  translator, Windows' default device. While a conversation runs the lists still update,
  nothing loaded is touched, and the line says the change applies at the next Start.
  - New with it: a folder Volis can't understand is now **listed, greyed out, with the reason**
    as its tooltip (recognizers and translators). Before, it appeared only in `--report`.
  - Check (`tests/test_rescan.py`, 10 tests, on a temporary models folder): a folder added
    appears; renamed, it disappears and the line says the choice changed; a headset appears in
    both device lists; unplugged while chosen, the choice returns to the system default. Also
    run against the real app and models folder: nothing changed / folder added / renamed /
    removed, each reported correctly, the user's choice untouched.
  - Not done by a person: a real headset plugged in while the app is open.
  - Found on the way: `models\asr\whisper-model-large-hmong` has no `config.json`, so Volis
    can't tell what it is. It now shows in the recognizer list as broken, with that reason.
- **P14 done: the window, for non-technical users.** All eight changes. The words the window
  uses are worked out in `gui/view.py` (no Qt, 14 tests): plain model names, the big control's
  label, why a control is greyed out, the won't-fit warning. `gui/devicetest.py` (no Qt, 8
  tests) is the two Test buttons. `tests/test_window_p14.py` (11 tests) drives the real window.

  | Before | After |
  |---|---|
  | ![before, stopped](docs/images/p14-before-stopped.png) | ![after, stopped](docs/images/p14-after-stopped.png) |
  | ![before, running](docs/images/p14-before-running.png) | ![after, running](docs/images/p14-after-running.png) |

  Advanced, opened: ![after, Advanced open](docs/images/p14-after-advanced.png)

  The pictures are made by `scripts/window_shots.py` from the real window, on this machine's
  models, with no model loaded (the running picture is fed the events a conversation sends).
  1. **Basic and Advanced.** Visible: the two languages, recognizer, translator, microphone,
     speakers, Speak translations, the mode. Everything else is under Advanced, closed until
     opened, remembered in `[window] advanced_open`. The settings scroll: with Advanced open
     they are taller than a laptop screen.
  2. **Conversation view.** While running the settings fold into a bar (languages, the two
     models) and the transcript takes the window. A− / A+ change its text size
     (`[window] text_size`, default 12). **Departure from the file:** the bar has a Settings
     button that unfolds the settings, because the mode can be changed while running (P6) and
     folding them away for good would have removed that.
  3. **Swap** exchanges the two languages and re-ranks the recognizers. Hidden in shared mode.
  4. **Plain names.** A list shows the name a settings file gives (`Engine.named`,
     `Translator.named`), else the folder name cleaned (`view.clean_name`); the folder, file,
     compression, size and backend are the tooltip. `fetch_models.py` has a plain name for
     every model (`PLAIN_NAMES`) and writes it into the folder's `volis-python.toml`;
     `fetch-models.ps1 -Names` does that for models already installed, downloading nothing.
     **Not done for the user:** their installed models keep cleaned folder names until they
     run that, and two (`Gemma 4 E4B (Q4_K_M, audio)`, `Qwen3-ASR 0.6B (Q8)`) keep the
     technical names written earlier, since an existing settings file is never changed.
  5. **One big Start/Stop control,** green, with the state in large letters and what pressing
     it does under it. New shortcut: Ctrl+Enter. The state banner is gone.
  6. **Test buttons.** Run for real here: the English and Spanish voices played their test
     sentence; Persian said no voice is installed; the microphone test recorded 3 s, played
     it back and ran Whisper on it. A recording below -50 dBFS says "nothing was heard" and
     loads nothing.
  7. **Reasons.** `view.disabled_reasons` gives every greyed-out control one line, shown as
     its tooltip and in small grey text beside it. While running they all say the same thing,
     so then only the tooltip carries it.
  8. **The warning.** An orange line under the translator when the pair won't fit (from
     `perf.verdict`, the same estimate as the performance panel), only just fits, or was
     measured too slow on this machine (recognition slower than speech, or over 3 s a
     sentence). **Limit:** "too slow" appears only for a pair that has been run here; there
     is no speed estimate for one that hasn't.
  - Not done by a person: "a first-time user can choose languages and start a conversation
    without opening Advanced" is the user's own test.
- **P15 done: type or paste text to translate.** A box under the transcript; Enter or
  Translate sends it, Shift+Enter is a new line, each line is its own row, marked "typed" where
  a spoken row shows its time. `volis/typed.py` (no Qt) holds the logic.
  - **Who translates it.** While a conversation runs, the running pipeline does
    (`Pipeline.translate_typed`, a "typed" command): the translator is never loaded twice, the
    line gets the conversation's context, is spoken by its voice, and when paired is sent to
    the other PC like any sentence. While stopped, `typed.Worker` loads the chosen translator
    on first use and keeps it until Start (which releases it) or the window closes; "Speak
    translations" then speaks through the chosen speakers.
  - **Compare translators:** a tick box; two or three translators ticked in a list; an optional
    reference box. Each is loaded when its turn comes and closed before the next, so two that
    don't fit together can still be compared. The table shows, per line and translator: the
    translation, the time, graphics card or processor, and chrF against the reference
    (`scoring.chrf`, as file mode). The window and `--compare-mt` both say the score is
    closeness to that reference, not correctness. Only while stopped (the window says why).
  - **`--translate "text" --compare-mt a,b[,c] [--reference "..."]`** from a terminal.
  - Typed rows are `SentenceMsg(typed=True)` events like any other: logged, kept in the run's
    record, and written by the export. (Export itself still needs a file run: see Later.)
  - A text box now keeps its keys: a space typed in it is no longer the turn key. That was
    already wrong for the glossary box.
  - Check (`scripts/p15_check.py`, the real command, Gemma 3 4B and TranslateGemma 4B on the
    GPU, each language's first FLEURS sentence against its FLORES+ reference):

    | | Gemma 3 4B | TranslateGemma 4B |
    |---|---|---|
    | Persian | chrF 56.3, 646 ms | chrF 55.4, 721 ms |
    | Arabic | chrF 85.0, 442 ms | chrF 94.7, 358 ms |
    | Spanish | chrF 55.8, 477 ms | chrF 42.4, 522 ms |

    Both outputs, scores and timings are shown for all three. (One sentence each: this shows
    the feature, not which translator is better. Both mistranslated the Persian for "leak".)
  - 19 new tests (`tests/test_typed.py`, `tests/test_window_p15.py`), one of them a typed line
    through a real pipeline with stand-in models. The picture: `docs/images/p15-compare.png`.
  - Not decided, noted: while running in shared machine mode a typed line is translated in
    the main language pair's direction, not a side's.
- **P16 done: the Persian clean-up step** (`volis/persian.py`, `[text] persian_cleanup`, on by
  default). After the guards and before translation, for a Persian source only, spoken or
  typed: Arabic look-alike letters become the Persian ones, and the half-space is put back
  where a recognizer wrote a space or nothing. The window shows the cleaned text; the row's
  tooltip shows what was heard (`SentenceMsg.original`).
  - **hazm: ported, not installed** (checked first, as the file asks). hazm 0.12.1 installs on
    this Python, but brings nltk, python-crfsuite and flashtext, and its normalizer loads a
    3.4 MB word list and builds a tokenizer and lemmatizer when created. Ported from it, with
    the source named in the module: the letter table (390 letters), `AFFIX_SPACING_PATTERNS`,
    the ZWNJ tidying, and `seperate_mi` with its verb list (`config\persian_verbs.txt`, 693
    stems, 7032 forms, user-editable). **Not ported:** its word-list joins, its removal of
    vowel marks, and its restyling of quotation marks, the decimal point and Western digits.
  - **Three departures from hazm,** each in the docstring: a mi- written apart is joined only
    before a verb when the verb list is there (hazm joins it to anything, so "ماه می سال", the
    month of May, becomes one word); ۀ becomes ه + hamza above; Arabic-Indic digits become
    Persian digits (Western digits stay). Arabic ة is left alone: Persian writes it two ways
    and no table can say which.
  - 21 tests (`tests/test_persian.py`), a rule each on real examples, one through a real
    pipeline with a stand-in recognizer, one for typed text.
  - **Measured (`scripts/p16_check.py`): no clear effect.** Ten Persian FLEURS clips, every
    installed recognizer that covers Persian and every installed translator, each sentence on
    its own, chrF against the FLORES+ English, as heard and cleaned:

    | transcript from | sentences changed | CER |
    |---|---|---|
    | the clips' own text | 2 of 10 | 0% |
    | Gemma 4 E4B (audio) | 0 of 10 | 4.5% |
    | MMS 1B | 0 of 10 | 4.2% |
    | Whisper large-v3-turbo | 6 of 10 | 6.6% |
    | Qwen3-ASR 0.6B | 4 of 10 | 20.5% |

    | translator | own text | Gemma 4 E4B | MMS | Whisper turbo | Qwen3-ASR |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Gemma 3 4B | 64.3 → 64.3 | 59.9 → 59.9 | 58.5 → 58.5 | 58.6 → 58.4 | 48.8 → 50.4 |
    | Gemma 4 E4B | 65.3 → 64.7 | 63.2 → 63.2 | 61.3 → 61.3 | 61.2 → 60.6 | 47.9 → 48.6 |
    | TranslateGemma 4B | 61.5 → 62.0 | 61.9 → 61.9 | 57.9 → 57.9 | 59.1 → 59.0 | 50.5 → 51.2 |
    | Aya Expanse 8B | 61.9 → 61.9 | 59.5 → 59.5 | 58.7 → 58.7 | 59.4 → 59.8 | 49.1 → 49.7 |
    | Gemma 3 12B * | 66.8 → 67.2 | 61.7 → 61.7 | 63.2 → 63.2 | 62.3 → 61.7 | 51.5 → 51.9 |
    | Gemma 4 12B * | 67.5 → 67.1 | 63.4 → 63.4 | 62.5 → 62.5 | 63.4 → 62.6 | 48.8 → 49.7 |
    | TranslateGemma 12B * | 64.6 → 64.6 | 58.9 → 58.9 | 63.2 → 63.2 | 60.4 → 60.7 | 53.8 → 53.6 |

    (chrF as heard → cleaned. \* doesn't fit this 8 GB card: about 4 s a sentence here.)

    Every change is between -0.8 and +1.7, and ten sentences can't tell that from nothing.
    **Where it was slightly worse:** Whisper's transcripts, with five of the seven translators
    (-0.2 to -0.8), and the clips' own text with the two Gemma 4 models (-0.5, -0.6). **Where
    it was slightly better:** Qwen3-ASR's transcripts, with six of seven (+0.5 to +1.7).
    Gemma 4 and MMS already write the half-space correctly: nothing to clean, no change.
    The transcript error rate doesn't move because the scoring ignores the half-space.
    - **No Arabic look-alike letter appeared in any of the 40 transcripts,** so the first rule
      was not exercised by this test at all. Every change measured is a half-space.
    - So on read news speech the step neither helps nor hurts measurably. It stays on by
      default, as the file specifies, and switchable. Whether it earns its place needs a test
      it can fail: conversational Persian, or a recognizer that writes Arabic letters.
  - **Also learned, the first Persian figures here:** recognition CER is 4.2% (MMS), 4.5%
    (Gemma 4 E4B), 6.6% (Whisper turbo), 20.5% (Qwen3-ASR 0.6B); and on correct text the
    translators score 61.5 to 67.5, Gemma 4 12B highest. `MODELS.md` has them.
- **P17 in progress: seq2seq translators (MADLAD, NLLB, Marian).** *Built and tested without a
  model* (`tests/test_seq2seq.py`, stand-in model):
  - `volis/translate/seq2seq.py`: backend `seq2seq` (`AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM`, 4 beams), the
    `NLLB` and `MADLAD` code tables, `code_for` (variety, then language, then ISO 639-3; a
    variety the model lacks falls back with a note), `codes_from_vocab` (the check against the
    loaded tokenizer) and `codes_in` (the same from `tokenizer.json`, for the model list).
  - `models.py`: `_text_seq2seq_family`, `_seq2seq_translator`; `Translator.languages`.
    `--report` prints the family and the languages.
  - `translate_checked(..., prompted=False)` skips only the "recited" guard.
  - The fallback note travels `TranslationResult.note` -> `Translated.note` -> the row's notes
    column (and `typed.Result.note`). The translator list's tooltip says what these models
    can't do (`view.translator_limits`).
  - `fetch_models.py` has both models (group `tested`), without MADLAD's `.gguf` files.
  - **Still to do, in this order:**
    1. Download (needs the user's OK): `.\fetch-models.ps1 -Group tested` entries
       `google/madlad400-3b-mt` (11.8 GB) and `facebook/nllb-200-distilled-1.3B` (5.5 GB,
       `pytorch_model.bin` only: confirm transformers loads it offline).
    2. Run `tests/test_seq2seq.py` (its last test uses the real models) and verify on the real
       tokenizers: every code in the two tables, MADLAD in float16 (T5 can overflow in half
       precision: if the output is empty or garbage, default it to float32 or bfloat16), and
       whether 5.9 GB + beams fits the 8 GB card.
    3. The check: both models on the Persian and Arabic fixtures, from text
       (`--translate ... --compare-mt`) and from a file; chrF into `MODELS.md` beside the Gemma
       rows, Persian clean-up on. `scripts/p16_check.py --mt <id>` already gives fa>en.
    4. CTranslate2: not yet tried. Verify `ctranslate2` installs with `uv` and runs in-process;
       add the second path (folders with `model.bin`) or report why not.
    5. Not yet done in the window: a translator that lacks the chosen language is refused when
       it translates, not greyed out beforehand. README has no P17 text yet (add once measured).

### Later (noted in `volis-next-features.md`, deliberately not in this round)

- Translating the computer's own sound (loopback capture), with an always-on-top caption window.
- A replay button per row.
- Speaker labels in file mode (sherpa-onnx speaker diarization).
- A full-screen "show the other person" view.
- Saving every live session as a transcript. **Checked: export does not cover live sessions.**
  File > Export works only after a file run (`MainWindow.export` refuses without a file); a
  live conversation is kept in the log file only.

## Open list (2026-10-02)

Waiting on the user:
- The built folder on a second Windows PC (rebuild first: `.\build.ps1`), and English
  recognition with `whisper-large-v3-turbo` on the user's own voice.
- Two machines paired: when a second Windows machine is available.
- Vowel marks for Arabic: a linguist's opinion, or an automatic check (proposed: speak test
  sentences with and without marks, transcribe the audio with the best Arabic recognizers, and
  compare with the text; fewer errors = more intelligible).
- Hold-speech for revision: set aside by the user; to come back to.

To build, when the user says:
- **Done 2026-10-03, see difference 73:** a performance panel (the user's answers, 2026-10-03). A developer's tool, shipped to
  everyone (it can be switched off in code before a deployment). Purpose: know what volis
  costs this machine, whether another model combination would leave room for another program
  (say, a video-over-IP messaging app), and whether something (more context, a long sentence)
  makes the cost spike.
  - *Now:* every number that bears on performance, updated about once a second: GPU memory per
    model, volis's total, other programs' and what is free; system memory the same way; CPU
    and GPU load; GPU temperature and clock; and per sentence, the time to transcribe,
    translate (with how much context it carried) and speak, and the delay from the end of
    speech to the first sound. Amber and red when memory is nearly full or speech falls behind.
  - *What if:* choose another recognizer, translator and voice and see, without loading
    anything, the memory it would need, its speed where it has been measured, and whether it
    fits this machine at all.
  - *Measure:* "benchmark this combination" runs a test recording; results are kept so the
    estimates improve.
  - Closed each time the app starts. Works in every mode (live, file, shared).
  - Proposed, for the user to confirm: a dockable panel (beside the window, or pulled out as
    its own window, as browser developer tools are), not an overlay; tabs Now / What if /
    Benchmarks; a short history graph with marks where sentences ended; the history exportable.
    Per-process GPU memory needs NVIDIA's NVML library (`nvidia-ml-py`), a new dependency.
- An English test recording with references, as the Spanish and Arabic ones.
- A GPU/CPU choice for the translator in the window (now only `[translate] device`).

Later: the rename to volis (and dropping the Rust-compatibility rules); Linux.

## Environment, as verified at P0

- Python 3.12.10 (uv-managed), torch 2.11.0+cu128, transformers 5.18.0, sherpa-onnx 1.13.8 with
  onnxruntime 1.28.2 from the environment, PySide6 6.11.2, PyAV 19.0.0, peft 0.21.1.
- The development machine (RTX 4070 Laptop, 8 GB) has no CUDA toolkit, no CMake and no MSVC on
  PATH. Which matters at P3: llama-cpp-python is only published on PyPI as source.
- transformers 5.18's speech seq2seq mapping includes `whisper`, `cohere_asr`, `qwen3_asr`,
  `voxtral`, `granite_speech`, `canary`, `moonshine` and more; its CTC mapping includes `wav2vec2`,
  `hubert`, `wavlm`, `parakeet_ctc` and more. Qwen3-ASR and Voxtral may therefore run through
  `transformers` without llama.cpp's audio input (P11).

## Development models

`models\` holds **hard links** to volis-rust's model files (`target\release\models\`), made by
`parity\link_models.py`: the same bytes, no copies, and deleting volis's side never touches
Rust's. `models\asr\whisper-small\` is a hard link to model-converter's download of
`openai/whisper-small` (without its `fetched.json`). `volis.toml` is a copy of Rust's.

## Differences from volis-rust, with the reasons

1. **volis-only settings go in `volis-python.toml`, not `[volis.*]` in `volis.toml`.** Rust's
   `Config` has `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` at the top level, so any extra section would
   stop volis-rust loading the shared file. No milestone so far needs a volis setting, so the
   file doesn't exist yet.
2. **An ASR folder without `engine.toml` is examined, not skipped.** Rust skips it with a
   warning; volis recognises Hugging Face and GGUF folders, and lists anything it can't
   recognise as an error with the reason. TTS folders keep Rust's rule.
3. **Several translators.** Rust uses the one `.gguf` at the top of `models\mt\` and refuses to
   start if there are two. volis lists that file plus one or more per subfolder, and its report
   warns when there are two at the top.
4. **A GGUF with no chat template is listed as unusable,** because volis builds prompts from the
   model's own template (Rust hardcodes Qwen's). The Qwen3 file Rust uses has one.
5. **`--listen` and the window** don't exist yet; they arrive at P2 and P5. With no arguments
   volis says the window arrives at P5.
6. **Logs** go to `logs\volis.log.<date>` (Rust: `volis.log.<date>`), plus `logs\doctor.json`.
7. **Varieties error message** names both `volis/varieties.py` and Rust's `src/varieties.rs`,
   because the tables must stay the same (a test pins volis's to Rust's).
8. **Devices are PortAudio's WASAPI list** (sounddevice). cpal's default Windows host is WASAPI,
   so names and order match Rust's; the "F32" in each device line is assumed (WASAPI shared
   mode always delivers float32), where cpal asks the device.
9. **Resampling uses soxr, not sherpa-onnx's linear resampler.** A better filter for the same
   job. Recognition of 16 kHz input (the fixtures) is unaffected; audio from a 48 kHz
   microphone reaches the recognizer slightly differently than in Rust.
10. **The pre-roll length is a setting**, `[vad].pre_roll_ms` in `volis-python.toml`, default 600 ms
    (Rust's fixed value; the build file assumed 300 ms, but Rust already found 300 too short for
    "¿Cuántos años tienes?"). 0 turns it off. Segments also record where the detector itself
    said speech began, so the lead-in can be measured.
11. **The VAD reset** pops queued segments one by one: sherpa-onnx's Python binding has no
    `clear()`. Same effect.
12. **File input is new** (`filesource.py`): WAV, MP3, M4A/AAC, FLAC, OGG/Vorbis, Opus, ALAC,
    decoded by PyAV, averaged to mono and resampled like the microphone.

13. **`--compare` manages GPU memory.** Rust keeps every engine loaded. volis loads every
    engine if they fit; if the GPU models don't, they take turns (each loaded for its run and
    released) while the CPU (sherpa) models stay loaded. Runs are always one after another.
14. **Hallucination guards are new** (`[guards]` in `volis-python.toml`, each switchable). The
    speech-probability guard uses a second Silero model from the same `silero_vad.onnx`, run by
    sherpa-onnx at `min_peak_probability` (0.8): sherpa-onnx's Python binding doesn't expose
    Silero's probabilities, but it applies a threshold to each window, which answers "did any
    window clearly contain speech?". (PyTorch can't run an `.onnx` file, which the user had
    been told it could.)
15. **The console is UTF-8** (`__main__.py`), so Arabic and Persian reach it intact.
16. **Whisper through sherpa is created with `tail_paddings=0`,** as Rust passes; the Python
    binding's default is -1.

17. **llama-cpp-python is built here** (`build-llama.ps1`, CPU, kept in `wheels\`). Its
    published Windows wheels stop at 0.3.19 (CPU) and 0.3.4 (CUDA 12.4, too old for Qwen3 and
    for the RTX 5090); 0.3.35 is source only. Rust runs its translator on the CPU too.
18. **Flash attention is on.** llama.cpp defaults to "auto", which is on for the CPU, and that
    is what Rust's llama-cpp-2 gets; llama-cpp-python turns it off unless told. With it off,
    9 of 25 translations differed from Rust's; with it on, all 25 are identical.
19. **Prompts come from each GGUF's chat template** (Rust hardcodes Qwen's ChatML). For Qwen3
    the rendered prompt is byte-identical to Rust's `prompt_for` (tests/test_translate.py),
    with thinking turned off through the template's `enable_thinking`.
20. **Several translators**: `[translate].model` in `volis-python.toml` (default: the file at the
    top of `models\mt\`, Rust's); `[translate].prompt` picks a prompt file.

21. **Translation is per sentence, not per utterance** (agreed with the user before P4). A stage
    between recognition and translation splits each transcript at final punctuation; every
    sentence has an id, "<utterance>.<n>", used by every event, the export and (later) the
    timeline and revisions. Text with no final punctuation stays one sentence per utterance,
    which is Rust's behaviour.
22. **Events are one set for everything** (`events.py`), defined through P8 (partial, held,
    revised) so `events.jsonl` won't change shape. `--listen`, file mode and the window all
    consume them.
23. **From a file, nothing is dropped:** where Rust drops an utterance the translator can't take
    in time, a file run waits. Live use keeps Rust's behaviour.
24. **A stall probe** (a 50 ms timer on its own thread) reports when every Python thread is held
    up, the early warning for the window's responsiveness. Worst stall so far: 0 ms, with
    Whisper (GPU) and Qwen3 (CPU) running together.

25. **The window is Qt (PySide6), and its pane is a table,** one row per sentence: time, source,
    translation, notes. Rust's egui window shows a card per utterance. The same rows are the
    live captions and the file timeline. `Session` keeps Rust's shape and tests where they apply.
26. **Every PortAudio stream is opened on one audio thread** (`audio.on_audio_thread`), and
    PortAudio is initialised on it. Through PortAudio's WASAPI backend, a stream fails to start
    ("Unanticipated host error") when opened on a thread other than the one that initialised
    PortAudio, and volis opens streams from the pipeline's thread and the window's. cpal has
    no such restriction.
27. **The voice speaks sentence by sentence** (translation is per sentence), and "first audio"
    is timed from when the utterance was cut, as in Rust.
28. **Voice output in file mode is off by default** and has its own switch that is never saved;
    the half-duplex gate doesn't apply to a file.
29. **`--report --load`** loads each usable model in turn and prints device, memory and load
    time (Rust has no equivalent).

30. **A turn ends when all its sentences have run their course.** In Rust a turn is one
    utterance with one reply, finished when that reply ends. In volis a turn can hold several
    sentences, so the window stays in "processing" until every one is translated or refused
    and, when replies are spoken, spoken; the voice going quiet between two sentences doesn't
    end it. Taking a new turn cuts off whatever is being spoken, as in Rust; sentences of the
    earlier turn that arrive during the new one wait and play when it ends (Rust's rule for a
    reply that arrives mid-turn).
31. **The turn key is taken by an application event filter** (`TurnKeyFilter`), the Qt
    equivalent of Rust removing the key from egui's input before any widget runs.
    `[mode].turn_key` keeps egui's key names, since the file is shared.
32. **`mode.kind = "shared"`** isn't built until P10: a live run then takes turns and says so.
33. **Recognition has its own thread** (`AsrWorker`). The pipeline thread now only runs the VAD
    and hands work over, so a slow recognition pass never delays the cutting of speech. Final
    passes take priority over provisional ones, and a provisional pass that is already out of
    date when its turn comes is skipped.
34. **Streaming recognition** (`[asr] streaming`, off by default; Rust has none). While an
    utterance is spoken its audio so far is transcribed again every `interval_s` (the first
    time after half of that); words two passes in a row agree on are committed, whole committed
    sentences are translated at once, and the rest is shown as provisional text. It works in
    continuous mode and file mode only: a turn is recognised once, when it ends, as before.
    The final pass at the end of the utterance still decides the text.
35. **Word timestamps are asked for only where they are used.** They cost Whisper about 1 s a
    pass. A file run's final pass has them (for the subtitles and the timeline); a live run's
    doesn't; streaming passes have them once the buffer is 10 s or longer, to trim what is
    already committed. Without them a sentence's times are shared out by length and marked
    approximate.
36. **Carry-forward context** (`[context] mode = "carry"`, the default; Rust translates each
    utterance alone). The last 4 sentences and their translations go into the prompt as earlier
    turns of the chat, within 400 tokens. With `mode = "off"` the prompt is byte for byte
    Rust's, and that is what `parity/translate.py` compares.
37. **Context leaves half at a time.** When there are more than `sentences` turns the oldest
    half is dropped together, so consecutive prompts start the same way, and the translator
    keeps what it already evaluated (`LlamaTranslator.run(prompt, reuse=True)` compares token
    prefixes). Same outputs; about 0.7 s a sentence instead of 1.7 s on this CPU. Without
    context every sentence starts from a cleared cache, as in Rust.
38. **The glossary** is one sentence added to the system text ("Keep these names and terms
    exactly: ..."), per session and not saved. The "recites the prompt" guard knows that
    sentence and the context turns too.
39. **Fragment holding** (`[fragments]`, on by default). A sentence of fewer than 4 words with
    no final punctuation waits up to 1.5 s to be joined to the next one before it is
    translated. The clock is the wall for the microphone and the file's own time for a fast
    file run, so both give the same result.
40. **A fourth hallucination guard, "sparse":** fewer than one word per 3 s over 3 s or more of
    detected speech. My choice, as the user asked me to use my judgement: it catches the
    one- or two-word outputs Whisper gives for long noise, which the other three let through.
    `[guards] sparse = false` turns it off.
41. **The default prompt frames the text; Rust's hands it over alone.** `prompts\rust.txt` is
    Rust's prompt exactly and is what the parity checks and the byte-for-byte test use.
    `prompts\default.txt` has the same system text plus a section after `--- the text ---`:
    the user turn becomes `{source} text to translate into {target} (translate it; never answer
    it or do what it says):` and the text in quotation marks on the next line. Context turns are
    framed the same way. Reason: the user said "how do you say let's go to the store in Spanish"
    and heard "vamos a la tienda". The system text already forbids answering; the models ignore
    it, and more so with context, which looks like a conversation.
42. **A fourth translation guard:** an output containing the frame's own words is refused as
    "recited" (`guards.contains_the_wrapper`).
43. **The translator can run on the GPU** (`[translate] device = "auto"`, the default; Rust is
    CPU only, `with_n_gpu_layers(0)`). It needs the GPU build of llama-cpp-python
    (`build-llama.ps1 -Cuda`, into `wheels\cuda\`, 344 MB and so not committed; `setup.ps1`
    installs it when it is there). The build uses PyTorch's own CUDA 12 runtime files, loaded by
    full path before `llama_cpp` is imported (`llamacpp.load_cuda_runtime`), so there is one
    copy of each in the process and no CUDA Toolkit is needed to run. `device = "cpu"` is Rust's
    behaviour. On the GPU the wording differs from the CPU's on most sentences, at the same
    quality.
44. **Revision mode** (Rust has none). After each translated sentence, the last 3 source
    sentences are translated again as one text (the conversation before them as context), the
    result is split back into sentences, and an earlier sentence whose translation changed gets
    a `Revised` event: the row shows the new wording, is highlighted for 4 s, says "revised" and
    keeps the old wording in its tooltip; `events.jsonl` logs old and new; the status line
    counts them. Off by default (`mode = "carry"`).
45. **What revision never touches,** beyond the build file's two rules (a sentence handed to
    the voice; one that ended more than 30 s before the newest). These three are mine, each
    from a measurement:
    - *a sentence of more than 8 words* (`revise_max_words`): revising everything on the
      read-speech fixture gave 20 revisions in 14 sentences and a worse translation (Gemma,
      chrF 61.2 against 63.6). Long sentences carry their own meaning; a second translation
      only rewords them. If no earlier sentence in reach is short, the translator isn't asked;
    - *the newest sentence*: nothing has been said since it was translated;
    - *a sentence already revised once*: second looks flipped "doesn't" to "does not" and back.
    Also: if the joint translation doesn't split into as many sentences as the source, nothing
    changes (there is no telling which words belong to which sentence); and a difference of
    case or punctuation alone is not a revision.
46. **"Spoken" means handed to the voice,** not finished playing: once queued it will be said.
    So with "Speak translations" on, every sentence is spoken as soon as it is translated and
    revision changes nothing; the translator is not asked again at all. Revision is for
    captions and file runs. (An idea, not built: within a turn, hold each sentence's speech
    until the next sentence has been translated.)
47. **Live, revision gives way to new speech:** when sentences are waiting to be translated,
    the revision pass is skipped. A file run never skips it.
48. **Paired mode:** revision is to be off while paired (P9), as the build file says.

49. **Translation-only models (TranslateGemma)** have a chat template that takes the two language
    codes and the text and writes its own instructions. volis detects that template
    (`source_lang_code` in it) and gives it what it asks for; the prompt file and the glossary
    are not used with such a model, context still is. A variety its table lacks (en-US) is
    sent as the bare language.
50. **A turn crosses the wire sentence by sentence.** Rust sends one `Utterance` per turn;
    volis translates per sentence, so it sends one `Utterance` per sentence (the same
    message, more of them) and releases the floor behind the last. A marker in the translation
    queue (`END_OF_TURN`) keeps that order. Rust shows and speaks each as it arrives.
51. **Context stays local and revision is off while paired,** as the build file says: only
    the final translation of a sentence is sent. `[context] mode = "revision"` runs as
    "carry" in a paired run, and the window's box says "(off while paired)".
52. **A turn's last fragment is no longer held.** A short unpunctuated sentence at the end of
    a turn used to wait 1.5 s for something to join; nothing can follow the end of a turn, so
    it now goes at once (paired or not). Found while placing the floor release.
53. **Network interfaces come from psutil** (Rust uses the `if_addrs` crate); it was already
    installed as another package's dependency and is now declared. IPv4 addresses only in the
    peer panel; Rust also lists routable IPv6 ones. Typing an IPv6 address works.
54. **`SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on the listener:** on Windows two programs can otherwise bind the
    same port and each get some of the connections. With it, a second Volis on the same port
    is told pairing is unavailable, as Rust's bind error does.
55. **A file run never pairs** (Rust has no file mode), and neither does `--listen` or a
    comparison, as in Rust.
56. **Shared mode: one table, not two.** Rust shows each person's turns in their own column.
    volis shows the two columns as panels (language and key in large letters, the status,
    the side's pickers, a heavy border and colour on the active side) above its one table, in
    which each row is marked with whose words it is (an arrow before the time). A
    conversation reads in order that way, and the table is what file mode and export share.
57. **Any recognizer that is told the language may hear a side without the warning.** Rust
    warns for everything but Whisper ("decides the language itself"); in volis only
    Parakeet does, since Whisper, MMS and Cohere through transformers are all told. A
    downloaded model that doesn't say which languages it knows may be chosen for a side, with
    a note in the column.
58. **Context crosses the two directions on a shared machine.** What the other person said
    was translated the other way; it is given to the translator turned round (its translation
    as the source, its source as the translation), which is an equally true pair in this
    direction. So an answer is translated knowing the question. Rust has no context.
59. **Cancelling drops what is under way at every stage** (Rust's cancel generation, extended
    to recognition, which volis runs on its own thread): a turn being recognised, sentences
    queued or being translated, speech queued or being synthesised.
60. **The mode radio buttons are in an explicit button group.** With a third button, Qt's
    automatic exclusion between sibling radio buttons left two of them checked; found by the
    shared-window tests.
61. **Reading a GGUF's metadata walks its vocabulary in memory.** Listing five translators
    took 1.5 s (a read and a seek for each of 260,000 strings) on every start of the window
    and every `--report`; it takes 0.3 s now. Same result.
62. **llama.cpp speech models are driven through `mtmd_cpp` directly.** llama-cpp-python's
    own chat handlers take images only (they refuse a model that "does not support vision"),
    so `asr/llamacpp_audio.py` calls the multimodal functions itself: the audio as 16 kHz
    samples, the prompt from the model's chat template, greedy decoding. In this process, as
    everything is.
63. **Two kinds of speech model, told apart by name or by the folder's `volis-python.toml`.** A
    model trained only to transcribe (a name containing "asr": Qwen3-ASR) is given the audio
    alone, and its answer is begun for it with `language Spanish<asr_text>`, so the language
    is told and not detected. Any other (Gemma 4, Voxtral) is asked in words to transcribe
    the audio in the language. `prompt = "..."` in the folder's `volis-python.toml` sets the words
    (`""` = the audio alone). The language is given by its English name, never as a variety.
64. **A LoRA adapter for a recognizer is merged into its base at load** (`peft`,
    `merge_and_unload`), in memory only: recognition runs at the base's speed and no file is
    written. The base is the folder beside the adapter named like the last part of the
    adapter's `base_model_name_or_path` ("openai/whisper-small" -> `whisper-small`), or
    `base = "..."` in the adapter folder's `volis-python.toml`. It is never fetched.
65. **A GGUF LoRA adapter is a translator of its own:** a folder in `models\mt\` with the
    adapter `.gguf` and a `volis-python.toml` saying `base = "<translator id>"` (and optionally
    `scale = 0.5`). An adapter for another architecture than its base's is refused by name.
66. **Transformers translators** load the folder with `AutoModelForCausalLM`, build the prompt
    with the tokenizer's own chat template (Qwen3's thinking off), decode greedily, and pass
    the same cleaning and guards. For a model with no GGUF yet; a GGUF of the same model is
    faster (below).
67. **Holding speech for revision** (`[context] hold_speech`, default off). With revision and
    the voice both on, a sentence short enough to be revised is not handed to the voice until
    the next sentence has been translated (and the pair looked at again), or `hold_speech_s`
    (2 s) has passed with nothing following, or the turn has ended. It is then spoken as it
    reads at that moment and never revised again. A long sentence is never held. Without this
    setting, revision changes nothing once the voice is on (P8). Off while paired, as revision is.
    Measured (`scripts/p8_check.py`, `dialogue-es.wav`, 14 short sentences, the voice on): 14 of
    14 spoken, 6 revised before they were spoken, none after. The mechanism works; the revisions
    are as mixed as P8 found ("I can't find it." -> "I can't find him." better; "three houses
    and a motorbike" -> "and a dog" worse).
68. **Vowel marks for Arabic before the voice** (`[tts] diacritize` in `volis-python.toml`, default
    off; `volis/tashkeel.py`). Piper restores Arabic's short vowels with a small model
    (libtashkeel) before espeak-ng pronounces the text; sherpa-onnx, which both apps use to run
    Piper voices, leaves that step out. volis can now run it: a port of piper-phonemize's
    `tashkeel.cpp` on the same model file, through the `onnxruntime` Python package. One
    departure from Piper's code: U+064B (fathatan) is removed from the input with the other
    marks (Piper leaves it, and text that had one comes out with two). volis-rust has the same
    gap and no fix.
69. **`onnxruntime==1.28.0` is a dependency** (for 68). Checked: on Windows the package carries
    the runtime inside its own extension and loads no `onnxruntime.dll`, so sherpa-onnx's
    bundled 1.28.2 is still the only one in the process, in either load order (voice, VAD and
    the marking model all ran both ways; `doctor.ps1` passes). Adding it changed no other
    locked version: `uv.lock` gained onnxruntime, flatbuffers and protobuf and nothing else.

## Versions: what keeps a new machine the same as this one

- **Python packages:** `uv.lock` pins every package to an exact version and hash, and
  `setup.ps1` installs with `uv sync --locked`, which refuses to install anything else. A
  package is only ever added by editing `pyproject.toml` and running `uv lock`, never by
  `pip install` into the environment.
- **Exact pins that matter:** `sherpa-onnx` and `sherpa-onnx-core` 1.13.8 (onnxruntime.dll
  1.28.2, as volis-rust links), `onnxruntime` 1.28.0, `llama-cpp-python` 0.3.35 (the wheel in
  `wheels\`; the GPU build in `wheels\cuda\` is made on the machine by `build-llama.ps1 -Cuda`
  and needs CUDA Toolkit 12.9), torch 2.11.0+cu128 (carries the CUDA 12 runtime the GPU
  llama.cpp loads), transformers 5.18.0, peft 0.21.1, Python 3.12.10, uv 0.11.x.
- **Models are not pinned to a revision.** `fetch-models.ps1` takes each repo's current files,
  and the sherpa-onnx archives and `libtashkeel_model.ort` from their current URLs. A
  publisher who replaces a file changes what a new machine gets. For a deployment, copy the
  `models\` folder from a machine that works rather than download again; that is also what
  the copy-to-run folder (P12) does.
- **Not carried by the repo:** the GPU wheel (344 MB, git-ignored) and `models\`. A new
  development machine needs `build-llama.ps1 -Cuda` once, or the wheel copied into
  `wheels\cuda\` before `setup.ps1`.
70. **The built program is a console program**, as volis-rust is (it has no
    `windows_subsystem` setting): a double-click opens the window with a console behind it, and
    the same exe takes every command-line option. A window-only exe would need a second
    build of the same folder for the command line.
71. **`--doctor`**, new: the same checks as `doctor.ps1`, available in the built folder, where
    there is no `doctor.ps1` and no environment. There it checks the folder's own libraries
    instead of package records, and adds one check: every library loaded comes from the folder
    or from Windows (Windows Defender's scanning library, which it puts into every process,
    counts as Windows).
72. **The sherpa-onnx recognizer folders end in `-onnx-int8`** (`whisper-large-v3-turbo-onnx-int8`,
    `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-onnx-int8`, and the two converted fine-tunes), at the user's request, so
    the picker shows which recognizers are compressed ONNX on the CPU. volis-rust's own folders
    keep their names; folder names mean nothing to it. `whisper-large-v3-turbo` is now OpenAI's
    original, on the GPU: on the fixtures it scored Spanish CER 0.5% (int8: 0.6%) and Arabic 3.3%
    (int8: 5.2%), at RTF 0.33 and 0.22 against 0.41 and 0.52.
73. **The performance panel** (View > Performance, `volis/perf.py`, `gui/perf_panel.py`), at
    the user's request; volis-rust has none. GPU figures from `nvidia-smi` once a second (a
    short program that reads counters; no new library). Windows reports N/A for each process's
    GPU memory, so volis's share is the sum of its loaded models (`ModelLoaded`) and other
    programs' is the rest. `Translated` events now carry `context_turns`, how many earlier
    sentences went with the sentence. Measurements are kept in `logs\performance.json`.
    Checked on the Spanish fixture in the real window: 14 sentences timed with their context,
    the run recorded, and What if saying Gemma 4 12B with the Spanish Whisper doesn't fit 8 GB.

## P12 findings

- **PyInstaller 6.22.3, one-folder mode** (`volis.spec`), in uv.lock's `build` group so a
  build machine gets the same version. It collected torch with its CUDA libraries, PySide6,
  sounddevice's PortAudio, PyAV, onnxruntime and transformers by its own hooks. What it can't
  see is named in the spec: llama.cpp's and sherpa-onnx's DLLs (loaded by path), librosa's
  `.pyi` stubs, sacrebleu's tokenizers; and transformers, torch and peft kept as `.py` too,
  since they read their own source. No UPX: compressed DLLs are what scanners flag.
- **Size:** 5.6 GB for the program (`_internal\`), plus `models\` (47 GB here, everything in
  MODELS.md). Build time about 4 minutes.
- **`scripts\p12_check.py`, on the built program** (Qwen3 1.7B translating, this machine's
  `volis-python.toml` otherwise, streaming on):

  Three runs each; the times vary run to run by more than built and source differ.

  | | built | from source |
  |---|---|---|
  | `--doctor` | all checks pass; onnxruntime 1.28.2 from the folder; GPU translator build; every library from the folder or Windows | |
  | `--report` | 18 usable models, app root = the folder | |
  | Spanish file, whisper-large-v3-turbo-es | CER 1.0%, chrF 59.3, 64 to 89 s | 64 to 76 s |
  | Arabic file, Gemma 4 E4B hearing | CER 1.5%, chrF 59.8, 86 to 95 s | 86 to 108 s |
  | network connections held, sampled every 0.2 s through every run | none | |

  The same check passed with the folder moved out of the repository (`D:\AI_Data\...`, run
  from `C:\`), and the window opened from there with no arguments, as a double-click does.
- **Found by the built window, fixed:** the hold-speech box (difference 67) connected three
  boxes to a refresh that ran while the window was still being filled in, when a user's
  settings had them ticked; Qt printed the error to the console and the window opened anyway.
  Fixed, with a test that fails without the fix.
- With this machine's own settings (Gemma 4 12B translating, which doesn't fit on 8 GB beside a
  recognizer) a file took 12 minutes instead of about one: the settings, not the packaging.
- **Not done here (needs the user):** the folder zipped and unzipped on a Windows PC with no
  Python and no internet; live mode there, and Resource Monitor watched for connections; a
  machine whose security software might remove DLLs. A PC without an NVIDIA GPU is not a
  target (the user's decision).

## P11 findings

- **Verified before building,** on llama-cpp-python 0.3.35, peft 0.21.1, transformers 5.18.0:
  `mtmd_cpp` has `mtmd_bitmap_init_from_audio` and `mtmd_support_audio`, and Qwen3-ASR 0.6B
  and Gemma 4 E4B both transcribed the fixtures through it, on the GPU; `Llama(lora_path=,
  lora_scale=)` applies an adapter (strength 0 gives the base's output exactly, a strong one
  changes it, on CPU and GPU); `peft` merges a Whisper LoRA; `AutoModelForCausalLM` runs
  Qwen3 0.6B. Nothing had to be worked around with a separate process.
- `scripts/p11_check.py`, each backend on a fixture recording end to end:

  | recognizer | backend | Spanish CER / WER | Arabic CER / WER | RTF |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Qwen3-ASR 0.6B (Q8) | llamacpp-audio | 1.6% / 6.0% | 4.1% / 16.2% | 0.02 |
  | Gemma 4 E4B (Q4_K_M + mmproj F16) | llamacpp-audio | 1.1% / 3.4% | 1.5% / 6.5% | 0.08 |
  | whisper-small | transformers | | 7.4% / 22.7% | 0.13 |
  | whisper-small + Algerian Darja LoRA | transformers + peft | | 12.6% / 43.1% | 0.13 |

  Gemma 4 E4B's Arabic is the best measured here so far (Cohere Transcribe: 1.9 to 2.1% CER,
  7.4% WER), and Qwen3-ASR is the fastest recognizer installed. The Darja adapter is worse
  than its base on this recording, as it should be: the recording is Egyptian read speech and
  the adapter is tuned for Algerian. What the check shows is that it loads and is applied.

  | translator | backend | chrF | per sentence |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Qwen3 1.7B Q4_K_M | llamacpp | 59.1 | 389 ms |
  | Qwen3 0.6B safetensors | transformers | 58.8 | 1974 ms |
  | Qwen3 1.7B + adapter, strength 0 | llamacpp + LoRA | 59.1, 14 of 14 sentences as the base | 387 ms |
  | Qwen3 1.7B + adapter, strength 0.02 | llamacpp + LoRA | 59.6, 5 of 14 as the base | 394 ms |

  The adapters are synthetic (`scripts/make_test_lora.py`: a random low-rank change to one
  tensor), which proves loading, not that a trained adapter helps. No real GGUF LoRA for an
  installed translator was found to test with.
- **Not tested:** Voxtral (not downloaded; it is the second kind of model, as Gemma 4);
  streaming and the shared machine with a llama.cpp speech model (they use the same
  `transcribe` as every recognizer, without word timings); a LoRA on a CTC model.
- The transformers translator is five times slower a sentence than the GGUF one although the
  model is smaller: `generate` has a fixed cost per call that llama.cpp doesn't.
- `models\asr\gemma-4-E4B-it-GGUF\` holds a hard link to the Gemma 4 file in `models\mt\`
  (the same model heard and translating) beside its audio encoder, so it takes no more disk.
  Loaded as both, it is in memory twice.

## P10 findings

- `scripts/shared_check.py`: English on the left, Spanish (Mexico) on the right, a recorded
  sentence standing in for each person, real recognizers, translator (Gemma 3 4B on the GPU)
  and voices (played into the cable). Two turns each, three set-ups, 12 of 12 turns right:

  | set-up | left heard by (CER) | right heard by (CER) |
  |---|---|---|
  | Rust's models (its M7.6 check) | parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8 (29.6%, 2.3%) | whisper-large-v3-turbo-es-adriszmar (0.7%, 0.8%) |
  | a downloaded model on the right | parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8 | whisper-large-v3-turbo-es (0.7%, 0.8%) |
  | downloaded models on both sides | whisper-small (9.9%, 4.5%) | whisper-large-v3-turbo-es |

  The 29.6% is "twenty five to thirty years" against the reference's "25 to 30": Parakeet
  spells numbers out. Every turn: the log names the recognizer and the language it was told;
  English came out in `es-MX`, spoken by `vits-piper-es_MX-claude-high` (the Mexico-tuned
  voice, chosen first for a side set to Spanish (Mexico)); Spanish came out in `en`, spoken
  by `vits-piper-en_US-lessac-medium`. Each recognizer loaded once.
- **Not done: the same turns through volis-rust side by side.** Rust's shared mode exists
  only in its window, with keys. The recognizers are the same files and were compared with
  Rust's at P2 (Parakeet identical; Whisper int8 the same but for sub-sample differences).
- **Not done by a person:** two people at the keyboard with speakers at normal volume (Rust's
  M7.5 check): that the other key does nothing during a turn, that Escape silences a turn,
  that volis never translates its own voice, that whose turn it is can be read from across
  a table. The logic for each is tested; the room is not.
- The log line says `transcribing as "es-MX"`; the recognizer itself is given `es` (each
  backend takes the language of the tag), as Rust's M7.7 check asks.

## P9 findings

- `scripts/pair_check.py` against `volis-rust.exe` (its window, since Rust's `--listen` never
  pairs; two clicks in it, Start and Connect): volis dials Rust and both name the other;
  Rust grants the floor and only then does the microphone open; a sentence from volis
  arrives in Rust with its original; Rust hears Spanish through the cable and its translation
  arrives in volis with the original; the volis end killed with no goodbye, and Rust says
  "volis closed the connection"; Rust dials volis and they pair; Rust killed while
  volis holds the floor, and volis says "rust-volis dropped the connection", releases the
  floor and closes the microphone. 12 of 12.
- The clicks in the Rust window were made by Claude through desktop automation, not by the
  user. Not tested: two real machines on a cable or switch, the firewall diagnostic against a
  real firewall, discovery between two machines (two programs on one PC can't both open UDP
  47801, so on one PC only one of them announces), and a real conversation with voices.
- What is encoded is byte for byte what serde writes for the same message
  (`tests/test_wire.py`), and the decoder refuses what serde refuses (negative or fractional
  `seq`, a missing field, a non-string) plus half a surrogate pair, which Python's JSON parser
  accepts and UTF-8 cannot hold.

## Translator comparison (2026-10-01, `scripts/mt_bench.py`)

Text only (FLEURS reference transcripts, 10 sentences a language, FLORES+ references), default
prompt, carry-forward context, GPU build. chrF; "obey" = of 24 tempting sentences translated
rather than answered, alone / with context; dialogues = first sentence right at once / after
revision, of 12.

| translator (Q4_K_M) | GB | es>en | ar>en | fa>en | en>es | mean | obey | dialogues | ms/sentence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3 1.7B (Rust's) | 1.1 | 59.2 | 64.3 | 58.8 | 58.3 | 60.2 | 24 / 24 | 5 / 7 | 261 |
| Gemma 3 4B | 2.5 | 65.9 | 67.7 | 65.5 | 60.0 | 64.8 | 24 / 24 | 6 / 7 | 444 |
| TranslateGemma 4B | 2.5 | 64.2 | 66.9 | 65.9 | 60.0 | 64.3 | 23 / 24 | 6 / 10 | 511 |
| Gemma 4 E4B | 5.0 | 64.3 | 71.3 | 63.8 | 60.9 | 65.1 | 24 / 23 | 6 / 8 | 586 |
| Qwen3 8B | 5.0 | 64.3 | 67.3 | 62.3 | 59.9 | 63.4 | 24 / 23 | 5 / 6 | 867 |
| TranslateGemma 12B | 7.3 | 62.3 | 68.4 | 64.9 | 61.2 | 64.2 | 24 / 24 | 6 / 9 | 8040 * |
| Gemma 3 12B | 7.3 | 63.1 | 70.3 | 66.9 | 60.5 | 65.2 | 24 / 24 | 6 / 7 | 9313 * |
| Gemma 4 12B | 7.1 | 62.2 | 73.1 | 66.6 | 62.7 | 66.1 | 24 / 24 | 5 / 8 | 5909 * |

\* doesn't fit this laptop's 8 GB card and spilled into ordinary memory; not what a larger GPU
would give. Ten sentences a language: a point or two of chrF is noise. What holds: every model
from 4B up is 3 to 6 chrF above Qwen3 1.7B; the 12B models are not clearly better than the 4B
ones except on Arabic (Gemma 4 12B 73.1, Gemma 4 E4B 71.3, against 67 to 68); TranslateGemma
is the one revision helps most. llama-cpp-python 0.3.35 loads the `gemma4` architecture.

## P8 findings

- `scripts/p8_check.py`, 12 two-sentence dialogues where the first sentence needs the second
  ("Yo manejo. / Mi carro está afuera.", "Se cayó. / El sistema no responde desde las nueve.",
  "It's cold. / The soup has been sitting out for an hour."):

  | | right at once | fixed by revision | still wrong | made worse |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Qwen3 1.7B | 5 | 2 ("I manage." -> "I drive."; "He fell." -> "It fell.") | 5 | 0 |
  | Gemma 3 4B | 6 | 1 ("Pareces cansado/a." -> "Están cansados.") | 5 | 0 |

  So revision fixes a minority of what carry-forward gets wrong. The models mostly translate
  the joint text left to right and repeat their first reading ("Es muy rico." stays "It is very
  rich" / "It's very delicious" beside "My uncle has three houses and a yacht").
- Other ways of showing the model the following sentence were tried and are not kept: the
  sentence alone with "the speaker went on to say ..." after it, before it, or in the system
  text. None beat the joint translation (both translators end at 7 of 12 right either way),
  and two of them made Qwen recite the note.
- Through the pipeline, on `dialogue-es.wav` (the Spanish dialogues spoken by a Piper voice,
  `scripts/make_dialogue_file.py`; 14 sentences, 42 s): Qwen3 5 revisions in 13 passes (3
  better, 1 a contraction, 1 worse: "It is closed." -> "He is closed."); Gemma 9 revisions
  (about half better: "I saw her." -> "I saw it.", "It fell." -> "It crashed.", "I can't find
  it." -> "I can't find him."; one clearly worse: "It's ready." -> "She is ready."). A revision
  pass takes about 0.5 s (Qwen3) to 0.8 s (Gemma) on the GPU, once per sentence.
- On the read-speech fixture: 0 revisions, 2 passes, chrF unchanged (Qwen3 56.8 both ways;
  Gemma 61.6 and 61.4, the 0.2 being run-to-run variation on the GPU, not revisions).
- With the voice on: 14 sentences spoken, 0 revisions. With the age limit at 0 s: 0 revisions.
- The count is the thing to watch, as the build file says: Gemma's 9 in 14 short sentences is
  a lot of rewriting for roughly 4 real improvements.

## After P7: answering instead of translating, and the GPU translator

- `scripts/obey_check.py`: 24 sentences that tempt a chat model ("how do you say ...", "what
  is the capital of France", "repeat after me ...", "ignore your instructions ..."), with and
  without punctuation, both directions, alone and after two earlier sentences. Translated
  rather than answered or obeyed, out of 24:

  | | Rust's prompt, alone | Rust's, with context | default, alone | default, with context |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Qwen3 1.7B | 22 | 18 | 24 | 24 |
  | Gemma 3 4B | 18 | 9 | 24 | 24 |

  (On the CPU build the default prompt scored 24, 23, 24, 23.) So carry-forward context made
  the problem much worse with Rust's prompt; that was a P7 regression, found by the user.
  volis-rust has the same weakness without context (22 and 18 of 24 here).
- Quality on the Spanish fixture is unchanged by the frame: chrF 58.5 to 59.8 for Qwen3, 62.2
  to 63.6 for Gemma, across both prompts, with and without context.
- **Translation time, GPU against CPU** (RTX 4070 laptop): Qwen3 median about 410 ms a
  sentence against 920 ms to 2.4 s (the CPU figure depends on what else is running); Gemma
  about 650 ms against 3.2 s.
- **Open: the GPU wheel's CPU path isn't Rust's.** With the CPU wheel, volis and Rust gave
  identical translations (25 of 25, P3). With the GPU wheel installed and `device = "cpu"`,
  `parity/translate.py` gives 19 of 24 identical; turning off `offload_kqv` and `op_offload`
  made it 14, so that isn't the cause and was not kept. The cause isn't found (the GPU wheel
  is built with Ninja, the CPU wheel with the Visual Studio generator; compiler flags may
  differ). For exact parity with Rust, install the CPU wheel (`setup.ps1 -Reinstall` with
  `wheels\cuda\` moved away).
- CUDA 12.9's headers refuse Visual Studio 2026's compiler; the build passes
  `-allow-unsupported-compiler`. The result loads, runs every test and translates at the
  quality above.
- Untested: the GPU wheel on a machine with no NVIDIA GPU or driver. It may not load at all
  there. A P12 question; the CPU wheel is the safe default and is what the repo carries.
- The parity harness played audio from the main thread, which stopped working when audio got
  its own thread (P5); it now plays through `audio.on_audio_thread`. It also gives Rust a
  recognizer Rust has when the user's `volis.toml` names a volis-only one.
- GPU recognizers make one pass over a second of silence when they load (`HfAsr.warm_up`): the
  user's first turn took 1093 ms to transcribe against about 300 ms for the later ones.

## P7 findings

- `scripts/p7_check.py` on the Spanish fixture file (124 s, 14 sentences), Qwen3 1.7B on CPU.
  With whisper-large-v3-turbo-es:

  | | CER | WER | chrF | ASR RTF | translate / sentence |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | everything off | 0.9% | 3.0% | 58.4 | 0.34 | 2459 ms |
  | + context | 0.9% | 3.0% | 59.3 | 0.34 | 2424 ms |
  | + fragment holding | 0.9% | 3.0% | 59.3 | 0.34 | (0 held) |
  | + streaming, fast | 1.0% | 3.4% | 59.4 | 0.70 (97 passes) | |
  | + streaming, real time | 0.9% | | 59.7 | 0.63 | first text after 1223 ms |

  With mms-1b-all (no punctuation, so the file is 14 utterances treated as sentences): CER
  1.3 to 1.4%, WER 6.0%, chrF 58.6 without context, 59.6 with, 59.9 with streaming; one
  fragment held and joined; ASR RTF 0.04 without streaming, 0.12 with.
- So on read speech: context is worth about 1 chrF and costs nothing once the cache is reused;
  streaming doubles the recognition work (still well under real time on the GPU) and leaves
  accuracy where it was; holding rarely fires, because Whisper punctuates almost everything.
  FLEURS sentences are unrelated to each other, so this understates what context does in a
  conversation.
- Context cases (`p7_check.py`, and tests in `tests/test_translate.py`): "Me lo entregan el
  martes" alone is "I give it to them on Tuesday", after a sentence about an order it is "I get
  it on Tuesday"; "No la he visto" gets "her" after a sentence about a sister. **Not fixed:**
  "Yo manejo." followed by "Mi carro está aquí." is still "I manage.", because what would
  settle it comes afterwards. That is what P8's revision is for.
- Provisional text first appears 1.2 s after speech starts (the build file asks for about
  1.5 s): half an interval, plus one Whisper pass.
- The first try at context doubled translation time (the whole prompt evaluated for every
  sentence). Differences 35 and 37 are the fixes.

## P6 findings

- `scripts/turn_check.py`, through the cable: speech while idle gives no transcript and no level
  report, and the capture device isn't open; a turn with a 2 s pause inside is one transcript
  (407 characters, 3 sentences); taking a turn silences a reply at once (the open microphone
  then hears -90 dBFS); the mode switches while running, both ways.
- The level log's "digital silence - is the microphone muted?" fired wrongly when a turn opened,
  because its window counted time with the microphone closed; the meters now restart when the
  microphone opens.
- On the same Spanish file, Gemma 3 4B scores chrF 62.1 against Qwen3 1.7B's 58.4, at about
  3.2 s a sentence against 2.3 s (CPU). In the user's live test Gemma answered a question
  ("How do you say in Mexican Spanish...") instead of translating it, which no guard catches.

## P5 findings

- **Responsiveness** (`scripts/window_check.py`, Arabic file, Cohere on the GPU and Qwen3 on the
  CPU, fast): the window thread's 20 ms timer ran at a median of 20 ms, 99th percentile about
  36 ms, longest freeze about 180 ms (once, at the start of a run); the pipeline's own stall
  probe reported 0 ms. No library holds Python's lock for long. Scoring a file at the end froze
  the window for 380 ms until it was moved to its own thread.
- **The gate** (`scripts/gate_check.py`): with the cable as both microphone and speakers,
  half-duplex on gave only the Spanish that was played; off, volis also transcribed its own
  English voice and tried to translate it. As in Rust, speech that overlaps the voice is lost.
- **Right to left:** alignment isn't enough. A cell needs a right-to-left base direction
  (`DirectionDelegate`), or the final full stop and embedded numbers land on the wrong side.
- **Memory, measured by `--report --load`:** Cohere 4.1 GB, MMS 1.9 GB, Whisper turbo through
  transformers 1.6 GB each (all GPU); the sherpa models 0.7 to 1.0 GB and the translators 1.1
  and 2.5 GB (system memory).
- llama.cpp prints one line to stderr when Gemma loads (`llama_kv_cache_iswa: ...`) despite
  `verbose=False`. Harmless.

## P4 findings

- **The check:** a 124 s Spanish fixture recording, Spanish Whisper and Qwen3, `--fast`: every
  export file written; transcript CER 0.9%, translation chrF 58.4 against FLORES+. Arabic
  through Cohere Transcribe: CER 1.9%, chrF 61.9. ASR real-time factor 0.36 and 0.19;
  translation median about 2.3 to 2.4 s a sentence on the CPU.
- **Scores equal model-bench's** to four decimals on the same text (checked with model-bench's
  own code and environment).
- **References:** `tests/fetch-fixtures.ps1` now aligns each FLEURS clip with FLORES+ (en, es,
  ar, ar-IQ via Mesopotamian Arabic, fa) by its English text; FLEURS's ids aren't FLORES+ rows.
- **A `.ref.srt` is read as the transcript.** The spec doesn't say which side an SRT reference
  is; a translation reference needs the `.ref.json` form.

## P3 findings

- **Translation parity:** 25 sentences (14 Spanish->English, 11 English->Spanish, Rust's own
  transcripts from the cable run), Qwen3 1.7B, default prompt: **25 of 25 identical**, on the
  CPU, about 0.7 to 2.1 s a sentence (Rust's timings on the same sentences were the same range).
- **A second family**, Gemma 3 4B (`unsloth/gemma-3-4b-it-GGUF`, Q4_K_M), translates with its
  own template (no system role; it writes its own `<bos>`) and no code changes: 1.9 to 3.0 s a
  sentence on the CPU. Asked for Mexican Spanish it wrote "¿Qué onda, carnal?".
- **GPU for the translator** needs a CUDA build of llama-cpp-python, which needs the CUDA
  Toolkit (12.8 or newer, for the 5090) installed on the building machine. Not installed here;
  the user's decision.
- **llama-cpp-python 0.3.35 ships `mtmd.dll` and a `mtmd_cpp` module** (llama.cpp's multimodal
  library): the starting point for P11's audio-input check.
- **Recognition parity through the cable can't be made exact.** With both ends at 16 kHz the
  audio still arrives scaled (gain 0.9896) and not sample-exact, so Whisper's P2 differences
  stand as explained; Parakeet matched exactly on every Spanish utterance in P2. Exact Whisper
  parity would need Rust to transcribe a file itself (its test binary, built outside the Rust
  repo) - the user's call.

## P2 findings

- **Recognition parity with Rust (`parity/asr.py`).** volis-rust listens to the VB-Audio cable
  while the Spanish fixtures play into it; volis transcribes the WAVs Rust wrote. Parakeet:
  identical on every utterance. Whisper (all three int8 ONNX folders): 13 of ~33 differ, by a
  word or a capital. Cause, shown: Rust's WAVs are 16-bit, and changing the audio by less than
  one 16-bit step flips int8 Whisper's text ("Los personas" -> "Las zonas"; scaling by
  32767/32768 gives Rust's exact "Las personas"). So the WAV route proves Parakeet's
  configuration and can't prove Whisper's. Setting the cable to 16 kHz didn't make it exact
  (see P3 findings).
- **transformers 5.18 speech classes** (seq2seq): canary, cohere_asr, fun_asr_nano,
  granite_speech(_plus), kyutai_speech_to_text, moonshine(_streaming), qwen3_asr,
  seamless_m4t(_v2), speech-encoder-decoder, speech_to_text, speecht5, vibevoice_asr, voxtral,
  voxtral_realtime, whisper. CTC: data2vec-audio, granite_speech5_ctc, hubert, lasr_ctc,
  parakeet_ctc, sew(-d), unispeech(-sat), wav2vec2(-bert, -conformer), wavlm.
- **Fixtures (`scripts/transcribe.py`, 10 FLEURS clips each):** Spanish CER 0.5 to 1.9% for every
  model. Arabic: Cohere Transcribe 2.1%, the oddadmix Whisper fine-tune 3.7% in float16 through
  transformers but 8.4% as Rust's int8 ONNX (which cuts sentences short), base Whisper turbo
  5.2% **with no punctuation on any Arabic output**, MMS 5.8% (CTC: never punctuates).
- **A hole in the guards:** noise shaped like speech (band-limited, pulsing at syllable rate)
  passes Silero, and Whisper answers it with invented text: once "¡Suscríbete al canal!"
  (dropped by the stock-phrase guard), once a lone "y" that no guard catches. A possible fourth
  guard, for the user to decide: text implausibly short for the length of the segment.
- **Persian ("fa")** was missing from the varieties table; added in both apps (below).

## Changes made in volis-rust too, by the user's decision

- 2026-09-30: the translation prompt's dialect sentence read "aloud,using" and carried
  indentation and trailing spaces; fixed in `translate.rs`.
- 2026-09-30: `VOICE_NOTE_LEFT` in `config.rs` wrote its second comment line with 31 leading
  spaces; fixed, with a test, in both apps.
- 2026-09-30: Persian added to the varieties table in both apps: `fa` (Persian) and `fa-IR`
  (Persian (Iran), "Iranian Persian" in the prompt).

The Rust changes are left uncommitted for the user to review and commit, and `volis-rust.exe` is
not rebuilt (volis-rust doesn't know `fa` until it is).
