# Sets up volis for development on this machine. Run it once after cloning,

#     .\setup.ps1              install (or bring up to date)
#     .\setup.ps1 -Reinstall   reinstall every package, e.g. after security
#                              software removed a DLL and an exclusion was added
#
# Copied from model-converter's setup.ps1, for the same reasons: it keeps uv's
# download cache, the Python interpreter and the environment all inside this
# folder, so every native file lives under one path, the one to give security
# software as an exclusion. Nothing is changed outside this folder.
# This is the only part of setup that uses the internet; volis itself never does.
